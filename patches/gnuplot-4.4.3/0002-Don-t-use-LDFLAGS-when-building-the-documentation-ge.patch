Subject: [PATCH] Don't use LDFLAGS when building the documentation generator

The documentation generator is a tool running on the build machine.
Therefore the LDFLAGS computed for the cross compiler may not work, such
as the "-Wl,-rpath-link" flag which is not understood by the Darwin
linker.

The doc2gih is simple and doesn't require an external library. So we
don't also need special LDFLAGS. Omit them.
